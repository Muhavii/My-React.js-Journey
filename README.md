# My React App: Journey from Beginner to Pro

Welcome to my project repository! This project documents my journey from a beginner to a pro in React development. Here, I experiment, learn, and grow my skills by building and improving a sample React application.

## Project Structure

This workspace contains the following directories:

- **my-react-app/**: The main React application, including all source code, assets, and configuration files.
- **.git/**: Git version control directory (automatically created, not modified directly).

## About
This repository is a reflection of my learning process, showcasing my progress and the various features I have implemented as I advance in my React journey. Feel free to explore the code and follow along as I continue to improve and add new features!
